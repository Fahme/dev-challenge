A User of our platform.

// todo: 1. would be cool to include all the data and expand out the User type so it includes all the fields.
// todo: 2. would be awesome to include the Address type so we can return users Address info.
// todo: 3. adding in a Company field so we can also get a users company info would be cool, it will probably need a resolver.
